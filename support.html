    <h1>Momentum Support</h1>
    <p>Welcome! We're here to help you get the most out of Momentum.</p>

    <div class="contact">
        <h2>📧 Get in Touch</h2>
        <p>For support, questions, or feedback:</p>
        <p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:momentum@orioncolumn.app">momentum@orioncolumn.app</a></p>

    <h2>❓ Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <h3>How do I create a habit?</h3>
    <p>Tap the + button on the Home tab, select "Habit", and follow the setup process. You can schedule it for specific days, set times, choose colors, and add categories.</p>

    <h3>How do I create a goal with milestones?</h3>
    <p>Tap the + button on the Home tab, select "Goal", and set your target date. Add milestones to break your goal into smaller, achievable steps. You can track progress using increments, percentages, or milestone completion.</p>

    <h3>What's the difference between habits, routines, and goals?</h3>
    <p><strong>Habits</strong> are daily or weekly activities you want to do consistently (like exercise or reading).</p>
    <p><strong>Routines</strong> are sequences of multiple habits performed together.</p>
    <p><strong>Goals</strong> are one-time achievements with deadlines (like "Run a marathon" or "Learn Spanish").</p>

    <h3>How do I set up reminders?</h3>
    <p>When creating or editing a habit, goal, or milestone, toggle "Enable Reminders" and choose when you'd like to be notified. For habits, reminders are sent at your scheduled time. For goals and milestones, you can set reminders 1-30 days before the deadline.</p>

    <h3>How do I add a widget to my home screen?</h3>
    <p>Long-press on your home screen → tap the + button → search for "Momentum" → select a widget size → tap "Add Widget". Widgets require Momentum Premium.</p>

    <h3>How do I upgrade to Premium?</h3>
    <p>Go to the Settings tab and tap "Upgrade to Premium" to see subscription options. We offer monthly and yearly plans with a 7-day free trial.</p>

    <h3>How do I cancel my subscription?</h3>
    <p>Subscriptions are managed through your Apple ID, not through the app. To cancel:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open iPhone Settings</li>
        <li>Tap your name at the top</li>
        <li>Tap "Subscriptions"</li>
        <li>Select "Momentum"</li>
        <li>Tap "Cancel Subscription"</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You'll retain Premium access until the end of your current billing period.</p>

    <h3>How do I restore my Premium subscription on a new device?</h3>
    <p>Open Momentum → Settings → tap "Restore Purchases". Your subscription is tied to your Apple ID and will automatically restore.</p>

    <h3>What happens to my free trial if I cancel?</h3>
    <p>If you cancel during the free trial, you'll lose Premium access immediately. However, you won't be charged.</p>

    <h3>Can I export my data?</h3>
    <p>Yes! Go to Settings → Account → Export Data to download all your habits, goals, routines, and progress in a portable format.</p>

    <h3>Is my data stored in the cloud?</h3>
    <p>No. All your data is stored locally on your device for maximum privacy. We don't have access to your data, and it never leaves your device unless you choose to export it.</p>

    <h3>How do I delete my data?</h3>
    <p>Go to Settings → Account → Delete All Data. <strong>Warning:</strong> This action cannot be undone and will permanently delete all your habits, goals, routines, and progress.</p>

    <h3>How do I view my progress and reports?</h3>
    <p>Tap the "Reports" tab to see detailed analytics including completion rates, streaks, goal progress, and beautiful charts. You can filter by different time ranges (7, 30, 90, 180 days, or all time).</p>

    <h3>Why aren't my notifications working?</h3>
    <p>Make sure you've:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enabled notifications when Momentum first asked</li>
        <li>Turned on "Enable Reminders" for your specific habit/goal</li>
        <li>Checked that Focus/Do Not Disturb isn't blocking notifications</li>
        <li>Verified notification permissions: Settings → Momentum → Notifications</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Can I customize habit and goal colors?</h3>
    <p>Yes! When creating or editing any habit or goal, you can choose from a vibrant color palette to help organize and personalize your experience.</p>

    <h3>What are categories and how do I use them?</h3>
    <p>Categories help you organize habits and goals by theme (Health, Productivity, Learning, etc.). Assign categories when creating items to keep everything organized.</p>

    <h3>How do streaks work?</h3>
    <p>A streak counts consecutive days you've completed a habit. If you skip a scheduled day, your streak resets. You can view your current and best streaks in the Reports tab.</p>

    <h3>What's the difference between the three progress tracking types?</h3>
    <p><strong>Increments:</strong> Track progress by specific units (e.g., "Read 500 pages" - update by adding pages read)</p>
    <p><strong>Percentage:</strong> Estimate overall progress (e.g., "70% complete")</p>
    <p><strong>Milestones:</strong> Progress automatically calculates based on completed milestones</p>
